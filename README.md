# EducationalPkg.jl
_Tools for developing educational content with [Julia](julialang.org), 
[`Pluto.jl`](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), 
[`Documenter.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl), 
and more!_

## Motivation

There are lots of different flavors of open-source software packages. 
When we hear the word _package_, we might think of software 
[libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) that 
provide useful functionality that we might use in our own programs, 
and software [binaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file) 
that provide directly runnable copies of other developers' programs. 

In reality, the excellent dependency management provided by modern 
package managers can be used for a variety of purposes! In short – 
some modern software packages can be described as 
[_educational_](https://github.com/ferrolho/ModernRoboticsBook.jl) or 
[_scientific_](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl) in nature, 
as opposed to previously mentioned library and binary packages.

## Vision

You want to write educational content with 
[_computational_](http://computationalthinking.mit.edu/) elements: some 
combination of interactive homework assignments, notes with `LaTeX`-formattable math, 
clear and runnable code examples that describe a concept, nifty scripts 
that walk through the implementation of an algorithm, etc. 

For example, say you want to write a public note-set with concrete, 
runnable code examples. Julia and `Documenter` can be great options!
But say you only want to "write once", and generate all of the helpful
educational mediums without any additional work – you'd like to write 
each chapter of your note-set, and automatically generate a `Documenter`
website, a `Documenter` PDF, a raw Julia script with all code examples,
and interactive `Pluto` notebooks with all code examples. 
`EducationalPkg` can help! With the example usage pattern below, 
you can `generate` a new (educational) Julia package called 
`FutureBestSeller` with pre-set directory structures and 
continuous-integration scripts that convert your content to 
(any combination of) all those mediums _automatically_!

```julia
julia> import EducationalPkg        # just like Pkg!

edu> help                           # enter `}` in the REPL to enter `edu` REPL mode (output below shamelessly stolen from `Pkg.jl` source code)
  Welcome to the EducationalPkg REPL-mode. To return to the julia> prompt, either press backspace when the input line is empty or press Ctrl+C.

edu> generate FutureBestSeller      # alternatively, EducationalPkg.generate("FutureBestSeller")

edu> st FutureBestSeller            # visualize the `EducationalPkg` structure (this is the output of `tree` for now)

## Delusion

What if, in addition to Julia's [_General_](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) 
package registry (the home of _library_ and _binary_ packages), we had _Educational_
and _Scientific_ package registries for educational and scientific content?
For education, we could _add_ packages with `edu> add PackageName`, just like 
`Pkg`. All _Educational_ packages would be requred to have at least one of the 
following functions (and relevantly thrown `Exception`s in all other cases) defined:
`servedocs`, `servejupyter`, `servepluto`, `run`.

The _General_ registry already provides us with open-source _tools_. The `Educational`
registry would provide us with open-source _knowledge_: interactive assignments, 
descriptive notes, complete examples, and more! Students (and anyone, really)
could simply install a particular educational package with `edu> add PackageName`,
and they'd instantly have access to free and interactive educational content! 
Did you publish educational content, and later find an error? Simply push your 
changes with a new _Educational_ package version, and users will receive the 
updates when they run `edu> update`! There are so many possibilities!

Oh – sorry, was this the result of one too many ~~beers~~ herbal teas? Please disregard this 
section.

provide the entire `EducationalPkg` API within Julia's REPL!
