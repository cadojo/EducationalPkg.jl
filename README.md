# EducationalPkg.jl
_Tools for developing educational content with [Julia](julialang.org), 
[`Pluto.jl`](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), 
[`Documenter.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl), 
and more!_

## Motivation

We should standardize educational software distributions, just like we do for binary 
distributions and library distributions!

## Credits

The excellent [`ReplMaker`](https://github.com/MasonProtter/ReplMaker.jl) is used to
provide the entire `EducationalPkg` API within Julia's REPL!
